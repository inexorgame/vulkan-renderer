Coding Style
============

The easiest way to get the right format is to use the provided Clang format file at root.

Other styles which cannot be applied automatically are listed below:

- Use ``#pragma once`` as include guards
- Own headers are included with quotes
- Includes are ordered
    - Own headers
    - Third Party Libraries
    - System Libraries
- Use C++17 namespace style ``namespace inexor::vulkan-renderer``
- No ``using <namespace>``
- For default member initialization use equal instead of brace initialization
- Prefer American English over British English
- Use spaces to indent
- Use Linux line ends (ln) in your commits
- Multiline documentation should use /// in each line

Naming Convention
-----------------

In the ``.clang-tidy`` file and search for ``readability-identifier-naming`` to get the naming convention used by this project.

Error handling
---------------

- Use exceptions for error handling, as proposed by the `C++ core guidelines <https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#S-errors>`__.
- More information about why to use exceptions can be found `here <https://isocpp.org/wiki/faq/exceptions>`__.
