Continuous Integration
======================

- The master branch and the build system must stay stable at all time.

- You can see the current status of the master branch in the build batch:

  |github actions|

- Currently we are using `GitHub Actions <https://github.com/features/actions>`__ for building with `gcc <https://gcc.gnu.org/>`__, `clang <https://clang.llvm.org/>`__ and `Microsoft Visual Studio <https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/en/downloads/>`__ on every push or pull request.

- This `Continuous Integration (CI) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration>`__ allows for automatic building and testing of our software.

- We also have a `webhook <https://gist.github.com/jagrosh/5b1761213e33fc5b54ec7f6379034a22>`__ which directly dispatches the build status into our `Discord <https://discord.com/invite/acUW8k7>`__. This allows us to spot and fix broken code easily.

- `Our CI setup <https://github.com/inexorgame/vulkan-renderer/blob/master/.github/workflows/build.yml>`__ is inspired by a `blog entry <https://www.asawicki.info/news_1655_how_to_use_vulkan_sdk_with_appveyor_and_travis_ci>`__ by `Adam Sawicki <https://github.com/adam-sawicki-a>`__.
