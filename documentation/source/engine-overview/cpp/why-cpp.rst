Why use C++?
============

- C++ is a multi-paradigm language, which means C++ can do all forms of programming: object oriented programming, functional programming, template meta-programming, parallel programming, and much more.
- While C++ is a multi-paradigm language, it does not enforce any programming idiom upon you. Every programmer can freely choose how to program in the best possible way to find solutions to problems.
- In C++, you do not have a guarantee for good performance, but C++ lays down the foundation to achieve good performance if desired.
- C++ has an ISO standard (unlike Rust) and the programming language is updated every 3 years.
- Vulkan API is a C-style API, and wrapping Vulkan with C++ by using `RAII <https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/raii.html>`__ is an idea which is inherently linked with Vulkan.
- The C++ ecosystem has a rich variety of libraries which are ideal for developing a vulkan-renderer.
- Modern C++ has improved the way we use and think about C++ enormously. Many of the long-standing problems of C++ have been addressed and resolved. For example, memory management using new and delete can be entirely replaced with smart pointers.
- C++ has a very strong type system.
