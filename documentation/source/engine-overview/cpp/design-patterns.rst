===================

.. note::
    This page will be updated when `rendergraph2 pull request 533 <https://github.com/inexorgame/vulkan-renderer/pull/533>`__ will be merged.

- The most important introduction is this very famous book: Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, John Vlissides: Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software, ISBN 978-0201633610.
- Check out `Refactoring Guru <https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns>`__ to learn more about `software design patterns <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern>`__.
- `Don't use the singleton pattern <https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#Ri-singleton>`__ as it makes thread safety and refactoring difficult.
- Use the `builder pattern <https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/builder>`__ for composition of complicated data structures.
- An example of a builder pattern would be the `descriptor builder <https://github.com/inexorgame/vulkan-renderer/blob/main/src/vulkan-renderer/wrapper/descriptor_builder.cpp>`__.
