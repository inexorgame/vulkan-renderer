In general we accept every widely acknowledged license which allows to share, modify, share the modified work, make commercial use or any combination of these. The licenses we accept are listed here, and below are the ones we do not.

Why we don't recommend Public Domain
------------------------------------

The problem with Public Domain is that the definition is different from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. There is no international declaration. Also in some jurisdiction it's very complicated till impossible to make your work Public Domain before your rights expire after the ordinary time. 

Instead of Public Domain we recommend using `CC0 (Creative Commons Zero) <https://creativecommons.org/about/cc0>`__. CC0 is basically a license which gives the creator a way to waive all their copyright and related rights in their works to the fullest extent allowed by law + a Public Domain fallback if the waiving of the rights isn't possible under special circumstances.

The "or any later version" phrase
---------------------------------

While some licenses, which have different versions, apply such an "or any later version" phrase via default, some of the licenses requires you to explicitly mention "or any later version". E.g. the Creative Commons >= 2.0 licenses have this phrase, so everybody is free to license derivations of "CC BY-SA 2.0 Generic" content under the terms of "CC BY-SA 4.0 International". Other licenses like the GNU GPL license requires you explicit to write "GPLv2 or any later version." We recommend for every license, which has or may in the future have more than one version, and which doesn't contain such a phrase by default, to write it down on your own. This helps that content doesn't stuck with one ancient license forever, which could be incompatible with future law.

Licenses aiming at one special jurisdiction
-------------------------------------------

We reject content which is licensed under the terms of a license which aims at one special jurisdiction. We consider ourselves as an international community and we define freedom as the freedom for everyone, everywhere. Please, don't use licenses which could cause trouble, e.g. all Creative Commons licenses before the 4.0 versions have `local derivations <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons_jurisdiction_ports>`__ for a lot of countries (e.g. `CC BY 3.0 DE <https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/de/deed.en>`__). Starting with CC v4.0 there is only one international license to address this issue.

Common mistakes:
----------------

- Missing version number of the license (if exists), e.g. "Creative Commons BY".
- Missing full name of the license, e.g. "licensed under a Creative Commons license".
- Mix between the short form and the complete name, e.g. "Creative Commons BY Attribution 4.0".
