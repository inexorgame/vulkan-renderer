Licenses
========

In general we accept every widely acknowledged license which allows to share, modify, share the modified work, make commercial use or any combination of these. The licenses we accept are listed here, and below are the ones we do not. If you are not sure about something or the license doesn't appear in these lists, don't hesitate to ask us about it on our `Discord <https://discord.com/invite/acUW8k7>`__.

Special notes
-------------

We reject content which is licensed under the terms of a license which aims at one special jurisdiction. We consider ourselves as an international community and we define freedom as the freedom for everyone, everywhere. Please, don't use licenses which could cause trouble, e.g. all Creative Commons licenses before the 4.0 versions have `local derivations <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons_jurisdiction_ports>`__ for a lot of countries (e.g. `CC BY 3.0 DE <https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/de/deed.en>`__). Starting with CC v4.0 there is only one international license to address this issue.

We also don't accept Public Domain. The problem with Public Domain is that the definition is different from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, there isn't an international declaration. Also in some jurisdiction it's very complicated till impossible to make your work Public Domain before your rights expire after the ordinary time. 

Instead of Public Domain we recommend using `CC0 (Creative Commons Zero) <https://creativecommons.org/about/cc0>`__. CC0 is basically a license which gives the creator a way to waive all their copyright and related rights in their works to the fullest extent allowed by law + a Public Domain fallback if the waiving of the rights isn't possible under special circumstances.

Common mistakes:
----------------

- Missing version number of the license (if exists), e.g. "Creative Commons BY".
- Missing full name of the license, e.g. "licensed under a Creative Commons license".
- Mix between the short form and the complete name, e.g. "Creative Commons BY Attribution 4.0".
